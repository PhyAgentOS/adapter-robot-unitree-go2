Unitree Go2 Forge robot driver and Dora node

## Installation

Use Python 3.12 and install the frozen project environment:

```bash
uv sync --frozen
```

Install the project-specific optional SDK or test extras when needed. Hardware SDK and device configuration requirements remain applicable.

## Entrypoints

- `robots-go2`: `robots_go2.main:main`.
- `go2`: `robots_go2.main:main`.

Use each entrypoint's `--help` to inspect its options. Review the supplied configurations and robot limits before enabling hardware. Existing assets, workflow examples, calibration and device setup details are preserved in the [Chinese guide](README_zh.md) and repository documentation.

## Validation

Unit tests and simulated backends cover software contracts. Device motion, native SDK operation, model inference and release-artifact validation require their declared environments. A successful build alone does not establish hardware acceptance.

## Forge 2.x migration

This branch prepares node version `2.0.0` for Dora 1.x, frozen to Dora `1.0.1` for migration validation. It uses the official Forge 2.x distributions; Common is at least `2.1.0`. Regenerated locks and all executable entrypoints are part of the change.

Every change report must list repository, changes and test evidence, including per-node `dora run` records and a chained test containing `adapter-forge-gateway`. Unavailable hardware/model checks remain pending. Source PRs do not publish stable releases or synchronize GitLab; synchronization follows full acceptance.
